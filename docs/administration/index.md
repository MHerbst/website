# Advanced Functionality and Administrative Tasks

As a base technology openHAB uses [Apache Karaf](http://karaf.apache.org), a modern and polymorphic container able to host different kinds of applications.
The Karaf Console is a powerful tool to interact with the core of your openHAB installation.
Learn more about the advanced administrative capabilities of your openHAB installation in the sub-entries of this menu point.
