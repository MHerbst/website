# Configuration through HABmin

HABmin is a modern, professional and portable user interface for openHAB,
providing both user and administrative functions (eg sitemaps for users, and configuration utilities
to aid setup).

Please refer to the [HABmin Addon documentation]({{docu}}/addons/uis/habmin/readme.html).
